        <h2>About Weider's Six Training</h2>
        <p>Weider six (A6W) is an ABS training. If you want to have a flat stomach or a 6 pack this is the workout for you!!</p>


        <p>Each training session consists of 6 exercises each of which is repeated the number of times assigned for the day
            performed everyday for 42 days (6weeks).
            The training comes in two variants - 42 and 48 day. The later one allows you to workout for 6 days and have one day brake.
            However, every few days the number of repetitions in each set will increase, therefore making it more challenging for you and your muscles.</p>
